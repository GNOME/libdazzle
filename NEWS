==============
Version 3.25.3
==============

This is our first release of libdazzle. While we would love for a perfect first
release, we expect you'll find issues. So please help us get things stable as
we move towards GNOME 3.26.

Our focus is building a utility kit GNOME applications. If you want to see
practical examples of using Dazzle, we suggestion looking at the GNOME Builder
project which uses Dazzle extensively.
